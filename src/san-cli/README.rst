SAN: Distributed Contribution System
====================================

SAN is a blockchain-based contribution system & allows people to answer questions about creative projects like "Who did what where?", e.g. “Linus Torvalds created the Linux Kernel” or "Brian Chesky co-founded AirBnB in 2008".

The SAN cli allows you to interact with people, projects & relations in the SAN Blockchain.
